"""Batched neighbor list implementations for multiple systems.

This module provides neighbor list calculations optimized for batched processing
of multiple atomic systems simultaneously. These implementations are designed for
use with multiple systems that may have different numbers of atoms.

The API follows the batched convention used in MACE and other models:
- Requires system_idx to identify which system each atom belongs to
- Returns (mapping, system_mapping, shifts_idx) tuples
- mapping: [2, n_neighbors] - pairs of atom indices
- system_mapping: [n_neighbors] - which system each neighbor pair belongs to
- shifts_idx: [n_neighbors, 3] - periodic shift indices

    """Apply a strict cutoff to the neighbor list defined in the mapping.

    This function filters the neighbor list based on a specified cutoff distance.
    It computes the squared distances between pairs of positions and retains only
    those pairs that are within the cutoff distance. The function also accounts
    for periodic boundary conditions by applying cell shifts when necessary.

    Args:
        cutoff (float):
            The maximum distance for considering two atoms as neighbors. This value
            is used to filter the neighbor pairs based on their distances.
        positions (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (n_atoms, 3) representing
            the positions of the atoms.
        cell (torch.Tensor): Unit cell vectors according to the row vector convention,
            i.e. `[[a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3], [c1, c2, c3]]`.
        mapping (torch.Tensor):
            A tensor of shape (2, n_pairs) that specifies pairs of indices in `positions`
            for which to compute distances.
        system_mapping (torch.Tensor):
            A tensor that maps the shifts to the corresponding cells, used in conjunction
            with `shifts_idx` to compute the correct periodic shifts.
        shifts_idx (torch.Tensor):
            A tensor of shape (n_shifts, 3) representing the indices for shifts to apply
            to the distances for periodic boundary conditions.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            A tuple containing:
                - mapping (torch.Tensor): A filtered tensor of shape (2, n_filtered_pairs)
                  with pairs of indices that are within the cutoff distance.
                - mapping_system (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (n_filtered_pairs,)
                  that maps the filtered pairs to their corresponding systems.
                - shifts_idx (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (n_filtered_pairs, 3)
                  containing the periodic shift indices for the filtered pairs.

    Notes:
        - The function computes the squared distances to avoid the computational cost
          of taking square roots, which is unnecessary for comparison.
        - If no cell shifts are needed (i.e., for non-periodic systems), the function
          directly computes the squared distances between the positions.
